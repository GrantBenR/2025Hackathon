## Environment Details
Environment was created in VSCode using the built in Gradle bundle.

We used [JDA](https://jda.wiki/setup/intellij/) as our primary API to create the discord bot's behavior. 🤖

We used [Spotify Developer API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) to connect to users' spotify accounts and display statistics. 📈

## Testing
If you want to test the bot, simply add your bot to a discord server and paste your bot's key into a .env file. From there, create a new terminal and output the command ```./gradlew.bat run```. This will turn your bot, and any active changes, on so that you can test it.

## How can you contribute?
*You probably can't contribute.* This was made for a hackathon. We didn't get any sleep to make this thing. Probbaly never going to touch it again, so admire it as it is 🤩
