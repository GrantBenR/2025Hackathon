## Environment Details
Environment was created in VSCode using the built in Gradle bundle.
We used [JDA](https://jda.wiki/setup/intellij/) as our primary API to create the discord bot's behavior.
We used [Spotify Developer API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) to connect to users' spotify accounts and display statistics.
