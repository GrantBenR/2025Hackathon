# Future Considerations 🔮

## Possible Additions ⚙️🪛
The bot is at a *very early* stage in the overall development process, and with that, there are multiple different directions that it could move in with the various APIs.

*No particular path has been chosen at this point in time.*

## Missed Opportunities 😔☹️
Even though we were very content with what we were able to finish during the 24 hour hackathon in regards to this project, there were a few features and additions we were not able to finish due to the time limitation, **such as:**

- Cleaner output organization from the bot commands.
- Additional commands, such as top *artists*, *recent* songs, and *recent* artists.
- Better background processes for looping thorugh databases of sassy responses.
- Implementation of Spotify API's Refresh Token service so that users don't have to redo authentication.

## Plans for Continuation 📜
**Despite the the possibilities listed above, there are actively *no* plans to continue development with this bot.**

We are in fact still college students and lead very busy lives, so unless we feel the creative inspiration to give our son a future update, the plan is to leave him archived.
